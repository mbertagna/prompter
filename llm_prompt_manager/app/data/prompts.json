    "base_prompt": "Your role is to **create a complete, ready-to-use prompt** for a **coding agent** whose job is to implement or integrate a **specific feature or change** into the codebase.\n\nBase this generated prompt entirely on the **most recent feature or change discussed in the conversation**.  \nYour task is to translate that discussion into a clear, structured, and actionable prompt that guides the coding agent through reasoning, planning, and conceptually integrating the feature into the system.\n\nFocus on clarity, precision, and completeness.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Feature Implementation Focus\n\nCurate the prompt so it instructs the coding agent to implement the specified feature or change in the codebase.  \nEmphasize **conceptual clarity** and **architectural integration** across modules or components.  \nThe prompt should tell the coding agent to reason about *how the feature fits into the system*, leaving detailed implementation choices\u2014such as helper functions, naming, or internal logic\u2014open to their discretion.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Required Structure of the Coding Agent\u2019s Response\n\nEnsure the generated prompt tells the coding agent to structure their response using the following format:\n\n#### **1. Feature Overview**\n\nGuide the coding agent to summarize the **purpose, scope, and user value** of the feature or change in clear and concise terms.\n\n#### **2. Conceptual Breakdown of Codebase Changes (Without Code)**\n\nInstruct the coding agent to produce a **high-level conceptual breakdown** of all required codebase changes to integrate the feature.  \nThey should describe the **conceptual roles** of any new or modified classes, methods, or functions and indicate how these interact with existing components in the system.\n\n#### **3. Architectural Alignment and Guidance**\n\nTell the coding agent to provide **architectural guidance** showing how the proposed changes align with the system\u2019s overall design.  \nEmphasize principles of **modularity, clarity, and cohesion**, ensuring each conceptual unit serves a well-defined purpose.\n\n---\n\n### 3. General Coding Style and Deliverables\n\nInclude the following coding standards and deliverable requirements in the generated prompt for the coding agent:\n\n* **Docstrings:** All classes, methods, and functions must include **NumPy-style docstrings** written in clear, concise language.\n* **Comments:** Include comments only where logic is complex or non-obvious.\n* **Modularity:** Each function or method should perform a **single, focused task**.\n* **Emojis:** Exclude emojis from all text.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Context Files\n\nEnsure the generated prompt includes a section listing the files that will be provided to the coding agent for context.  \nUse a placeholder such as:\n\n* [List of all necessary files (e.g., `src/module_a/file.py`, `tests/test_file.py`, etc.)]\n\n---\n\n### 5. Output Expectation\n\nYour final output should be a **fully curated prompt** ready to be given directly to a coding agent.  \nThe generated prompt must be self-contained, unambiguous, and fully informed by the latest feature or change discussed in this conversation.",

    "description": "",
    "base_prompt": "**Codebase:** { {{CODEBASE}} }\n\n# **Your Goal:** Design a modular, DRY, and scalable organization structure for upcoming feature integrations.\n\n---\n\n### Primary Objective\n\nYou are tasked with proposing **codebase organization options** for [CODEBASE_NAME_PLACEHOLDER] one at a time.\nEach proposal should aim for **maximal modularity, clarity, and architectural consistency** with the presumed or provided structure of the codebase.\n\nAt each iteration:\n\n1. Provide **one** option for organization (not multiple at once).\n2. Wait for my feedback.\n3. If I request changes or refinements, incorporate them into the next iteration.\n4. When I explicitly approve an option, you will then generate a **final implementation prompt** for a coding agent as described below.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Iterative Codebase Organization Proposal\n\nEach proposal should include:\n\n#### 1. Conceptual Structure Overview\n\nProvide a **concise conceptual map** of how the system\u2019s architecture and components will be restructured or reorganized.\nExplain the purpose of each new or refactored module, class, or directory and how they fit into the broader design.\n\n#### 2. Key Modules and Responsibilities\n\nList the **key components** (modules, classes, or functions) and describe their **high-level conceptual roles** \u2014 what each does and how they interact \u2014 **without suggesting any specific implementation or code**.\n\n#### 3. Design Rationale\n\nJustify **why** this architectural approach improves modularity, reusability, maintainability, and scalability.\nReference design principles (e.g., SOLID, separation of concerns, dependency inversion) where appropriate.\n\n#### 4. DRYness and Extensibility Check\n\nExplicitly explain how the proposed structure:\n\n* Eliminates redundancy and tight coupling\n* Supports extensibility and maintainability\n* Aligns with or improves upon the codebase\u2019s existing patterns and conventions\n\nAfter presenting this, stop and ask:\n\n> \u201cWould you like to approve this organization or request revisions before proceeding?\u201d\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Once Approved \u2014 Generate the Implementation Prompt\n\nWhen I approve a structure, you will output the following **final implementation prompt** (filled in appropriately):\n\n---\n\n#### **Implementation Prompt for Coding Agent**\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n> Implement the approved architectural restructuring in the codebase.\n> **Focus on conceptual clarity, structural integrity, and modular organization**, leaving detailed implementation choices and low-level logic (e.g., helper utilities, variable names, or internal optimizations) to your discretion.\n> **Avoid overly specific implementation details** unless they are essential to preserve architectural correctness.\n\nYour response must strictly adhere to the following structure and content requirements:\n\n---\n\n### 1. Architectural Restructure Overview\n\nProvide a **clear and concise conceptual overview** of the architectural restructuring \u2014 its purpose, motivation, and expected impact on the codebase (e.g., improved modularity, maintainability, or scalability).\n\n### 2. Conceptual Breakdown of Changes (Without Code)\n\nProvide a **comprehensive, high-level conceptual breakdown** of the restructuring steps.\nDescribe which components, modules, or directories are being added, removed, or reorganized, and how they interact in the new structure.\n**Avoid suggesting specific code.** Focus on *what* needs to change and *where* it fits conceptually.\n\n### 3. Architectural Alignment and Guidance\n\nOffer **specific, high-level guidance** on how the restructuring aligns with and strengthens the existing architecture (e.g., enforcing separation of concerns, design patterns, or layering principles).\n**Emphasize modularity** \u2014 each module or class should have a single, well-defined purpose.\n\n---\n\n### General Coding Style and Deliverables\n\nAdhere to the following style guidelines in the restructured code:\n\n* **Docstrings:** Use **NumPy docstring format** for all classes, methods, and functions where applicable. Ensure the verbiage is **concise**.\n* **Comments:** **Remove all unnecessary comments.** Only include comments for complex, non-obvious logic if absolutely required for clarity.\n* **Modularity:** Ensure the architecture enforces strong modular boundaries \u2014 each component should perform a **specific, single role**.\n* **Emojis:** Avoid the use of emojis.\n\n---\n\n### Context Files\n\nThe following files will be provided as context for accurate and efficient restructuring:\n\n* [List of all necessary files (e.g., `src/module_a/file.py`, `core/architecture.py`, `tests/test_integration.py`, etc.)]\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Iterative Refinement (Optional)\n\nIf requested, you may help refine or adapt the generated implementation prompt (e.g., adjusting restructuring scope, architecture focus, or file list) before it is finalized for the coding agent.\n",
